Creating ChatBot for your website, is easier by including facebook messenger in you websites.

This can be done in many ways but here Am mainly focusing on to the begginers so I have taken this approch. (These steps given below are as per todays date July 2019)

 Step1: First create a busniness page of your website on facebook using your Facebook account, On your Business page Goto settings--> MessengerPlatform.

Step5: Facebook will generate a snippet code for you which includes a unique Id for you page only (so dont share this with anyone). The same unique Id you can get it from creating a project in facebook developers page(This website is created by Facebook for developers only, You are free to create any number of projects and completely make use of facebook in your projects).
Copy the Code and paste it in your website code at the begging of body tag.
