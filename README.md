Step5: Facebook will generate a snippet code for you which includes a unique Id for you page only (so dont share this with anyone. The same unique Id you can get it from creating a project in facebook developers page(This website is created by Facebook for developers only, You are free to create any number of projects and completely make use of facebook in your projects).
Copy the Code and paste it in your website code at the begging of body tag.
